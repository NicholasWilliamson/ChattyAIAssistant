I ran sudo compose up -d

I then received the following warning and error messages:

Warning: unknown mime-type for "up" -- using "application/octet-stream"
Warning: unknown mime-type for "-d" -- using "application/octet-stream"
Error: no "compose" mailcap rules found for type "application/octet-stream"
Error: no "compose" mailcap rules found for type "application/octet-stream"

How can I fix this?
