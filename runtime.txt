Thank you ChatGPT. You are great.

I first created the models.yaml as you recommended and saved it in the ~/ha-voice/models folder.

I ran curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "tinyllama.gguf",
        "prompt": "Hey Chatty, what can you do?",
        "max_tokens": 50
      }'
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8080 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/ha-voice $ 

How can I fix this?
