Thank you ChatGPT for your help. You are great.

I first want to point out that this development is not for use with my previous Chatty AI Meat Cooking Assistant. That was a different project based on the ESP32 Microcontroller.

This project is to create a local AI Assistant that accepts input from a microphone and speaks it's response via a USB Speaker, using a local AI model so that it does not require internet access to operate.

I checked my Raspberry PI's Memory usage as follows:

free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           7.9Gi       1.8Gi       3.2Gi        81Mi       3.0Gi       6.0Gi
Swap:          511Mi          0B       511Mi
