Thank you ChatGPT. You are great.

I was trying to download the TinyMistral model as you suggested using both wget and aria2 and received Not found errors..

I even typed the url https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyMistral-248M-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/TinyMistral-248M-Chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
into my browser and got a repository not found error.

How can I download TinyMistral?

I also tried to test minicpm as you recommended but it did not return a response after 3 minutes.

I ran the following:
