ERROR: Cannot install wyoming-piper==1.4.0 and wyoming==1.5.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested wyoming==1.5.2
    wyoming-piper 1.4.0 depends on wyoming==1.1.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
