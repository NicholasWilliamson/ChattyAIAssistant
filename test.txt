Thank you, Claude,

I have my chatty_ai.py Python script to run my Chatty AI Assistant, including faster whisper for stt, piper for tts, Tinyllama as a local LLM, facial recognition detection and many other features.

I am using chatty_ai.py through a Web UI page at http://localhost:5000 on my Raspberry PI 5.

My /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py Python script is as follows:

chatty_ai.py

I would now like the Tinyllama LLM - tinyllama-models/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q4_K_M.gguf, the English US Amy voice model - home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/voices/en_US-amy-low/en_US-amy-low.onnx, the faster whisper, piper and any other services that can be preloaded, to be preloaded when my Raspberry PI 5 boots up.

This is to dramatically increase response and processing speed for my Chatty AI Assistant.

Please instruct me as to how I can achieve this?

Also, I would like a much cooler and more high tech looking web ui page.

Please keep the JavaScript functionality and page layout exactly the same as it is now but make the web page asthetically look more high tech, possibly with an animated lattice of different sized trangular in the background that respond to the mouse cursors location and use a bright fluorescent colors for everything except for the text in the display boxes.
