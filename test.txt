The issue is clear now! The server is running on HTTP but the SocketIO connection is failing. This is a WebSocket/SocketIO connection problem, not a camera problem.
Looking at the server output, I can see the Flask server is running but the SocketIO connection is timing out. Let's check a few things:
First, let's see what's happening with SocketIO:
bash# Check if there are any SocketIO-related errors in the code
grep -n -A 5 -B 5 "socketio" chatty_ai.py | head -20
The issue might be with CORS or SocketIO configuration. Let's check the SocketIO initialization:
bash# Find the SocketIO initialization
grep -n -A 10 -B 5 "SocketIO\|socketio.*init" chatty_ai.py
Let's also check if there are any firewall or network issues:
bash# Test if the server is actually accessible
curl -I http://localhost:5001
Most likely fix - SocketIO configuration issue. Let's find and fix the SocketIO setup:
bash# Look for the SocketIO configuration
grep -n -A 15 "__init__" chatty_ai.py | grep -A 15 -B 5 socketio
The problem is likely in the SocketIO configuration. Common issues:

CORS settings - SocketIO might be blocking cross-origin requests
Transport methods - WebSocket transport might be failing
Threading mode - SocketIO threading configuration

Let's fix this by updating the SocketIO initialization. First, let me see the current setup:
bash# Find where SocketIO is initialized
grep -n "SocketIO" chatty_ai.py
Run these commands and show me the output. The camera monitoring thread isn't even starting because the SocketIO connection is failing, which means the "Start System" button click isn't reaching the server.
Quick test to verify the issue:
bash# Try to manually trigger a simple HTTP endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/some-test-endpoint
This will help us determine if it's:

A general server connectivity issue
Specifically a SocketIO/WebSocket problem
A CORS issue

Once we see the SocketIO configuration, I can provide the exact fix.
