I can see several issues:

Still a process using port 5000 (PID 27701)
The camera monitoring function got corrupted - there are duplicate docstrings and emit_log calls

Let's fix both:
bash# Kill the remaining process
sudo kill -9 27701

# Fix the corrupted camera monitoring function
sed -i '1367,1372c\
        """Main camera monitoring loop for web interface"""\
        logger.info("Camera monitoring thread started - DEBUG INFO")\
        logger.info(f"system_running: {self.system_running}, monitor_running: {self.monitor_running}")\
        self.emit_log("Camera monitoring thread started", '"'"'success'"'"')' chatty_ai.py
Let's verify the fix:
bashsed -n '1365,1380p' chatty_ai.py
Now try running:
bashpython3 chatty_ai.py
Access at: http://localhost:5001
When you click "Start System", watch the console output carefully for:

"Camera monitoring thread started - DEBUG INFO"
The values of system_running and monitor_running
Any camera-related errors

Also check the browser developer console (F12 â†’ Console tab) for any JavaScript errors.
If the video still doesn't show, let's also check what's happening in the video feed route. The issue might be that self.current_frame is not being set properly.
Let's add some debugging to see if frames are being captured:
bash# Add debug to see if frames are being captured
grep -n -A 20 "self.current_frame = display_frame" chatty_ai.py
Once you run it and click "Start System", tell me:

What debug output you see in the console
Any errors in the browser console (F12)
If you navigate directly to http://localhost:5001/video_feed, what do you see?

This will help us pinpoint exactly where the video pipeline is breaking.
