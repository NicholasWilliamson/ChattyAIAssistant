Thank you, Claude,

I made the changes you recommended and the TTS is now working perfectly.

I then ran: python3 chatty_ai.py and everything appeared to work perfectly.

I opened http://localhost:5001 in my Chromium browser on my Raspberry PI 5.

I click on the Start Service button. Facial detection correctly recognized me and spoke the greeting response.

I notice the following error in the logs: "Wake word detection error: 'ChattyAIWebServer' object has no attribute 'play_beep'"

How can I fix this error?

Another minor issue is that when the facial detection function detects a person registered in the facial detection model, it should randomly select one of the responses from the greeting_responses.txt file, incorporating the detected person's name.

If the system does not detect a person's face as registered in the facial recognition model, it should randomly select one of the responses from the visitor_greeting_responses.txt file or the warning_responses.txt file, depending on the time of day.

Please fix this issue as well.
