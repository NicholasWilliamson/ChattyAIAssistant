Thank you, Claude,

I made the changes you recommended.

I ran: python3 chatty_ai.py

I opened my Chromium browser on my Raspberry PI 5 with http://localhost:5001

I clicked on the Start Service buttion.

The AI Assistant correctly recognized me via facial detection recognition.

The wake word detection service started correctly but did not detect my correct wake phrase as displayed in the translation.

The System Logs box displayed:
