

Thank you, Claude,

I ran: (chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi:~/Chatty_AI $ pip install numpy
Requirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (2.2.4)
(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi:~/Chatty_AI $ pip install faster-whisper==0.10.0

  Getting requirements to build wheel ... error
  error: subprocess-exited-with-error
  
  Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
  exit code: 1
  
  [6 lines of output]
  Package libavdevice was not found in the pkg-config search path.
  Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libavdevice.pc'
  to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
  Package 'libavdevice', required by 'virtual:world', not found
  Package 'libavfilter', required by 'virtual:world', not found
  pkg-config could not find libraries ['avformat', 'avcodec', 'avdevice', 'avutil', 'avfilter', 'swscale', 'swresample']
  [end of output]
  
  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
ERROR: Failed to build 'av' when getting requirements to build wheel

How can I fix this error?
