Since the LLM responds in under 1 second when tested directly, the delay must be elsewhere. Let's find it.
Check the full question-processing pipeline:
bash# Find the function that handles user questions
grep -n "def.*question\|def.*process\|def.*handle\|def.*respond" /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py | head -20
Check around line 835 where the LLM is called:
bashsed -n '800,900p' /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py
Check the wake word and speech processing flow:
bashgrep -n "transcribe\|speak\|piper\|wake_word" /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py | head -30

About the Second Camera
Only your Pi Camera Module 3 (IMX708) is being detected. To use the Waveshare IMX219:

Check physical connection - The IMX219 needs to be on a different CSI port
Check if dual camera is enabled:

bash# Check for second CSI port configuration
cat /boot/firmware/config.txt | grep -i "dtoverlay\|csi"
For dual cameras, you typically need to add overlay configuration. But let's focus on the LLM delay first.

Find Where the Delay Occurs
Run these commands to identify the bottleneck:
bashsed -n '800,900p' /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py
bashgrep -n "def.*question\|def.*process\|def.*handle\|def.*respond" /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/chatty_ai.py | head -20
This will show us the code path from receiving a question to generating a response, so we can identify where the 15+ second delay is happening.
