This means:

üîå Your script tried to connect to http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions, but nothing was listening on port 8080. So, the connection was refused.

‚úÖ Fix: Start LocalAI
You need to start the LocalAI server, since it‚Äôs the backend serving TinyLLaMA. Here's how to proceed:

üß≠ Step-by-Step Instructions
1. üß† Start LocalAI
If you've already built or downloaded LocalAI, run this command in a separate terminal from your project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
./local-ai -m models/tinyllama.gguf --model-name tinyllama
Adjust the model path and name based on your setup:

-m: path to your .gguf model (TinyLLaMA).

--model-name: what you refer to in your script (tinyllama).

You should see output like:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[INFO] Starting LocalAI on :8080
[INFO] Model loaded: tinyllama
If you don‚Äôt have local-ai installed yet, I can walk you through setting that up too.

2. ‚úÖ Verify It's Running
Before rerunning chatty_ai.py, test that LocalAI is up:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
You should see a response listing the models loaded, like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "tinyllama",
      "object": "model"
    }
  ]
}
3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Rerun Your Script
Now that LocalAI is up and serving on port 8080, go back to your chatty-venv terminal and rerun:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 chatty_ai.py
It should now successfully:

Record your voice.

Transcribe with Faster-Whisper.

Send the text to TinyLLaMA.

Get a reply.

Speak it using Piper.

‚ö†Ô∏è Optional Improvements (Next Steps)
Later, consider adding:

üß™ Check if LocalAI is running before calling the API.

üßµ Add retry logic or error message like:
"LocalAI is not running. Please start it with ./local-ai ..."

Would you like help with:

Setting up LocalAI from scratch?

Running it via Docker?

Auto-launching it with your assistant?

Thank you ChatGPT. You are great. Yes please, show me how to setup LocalAI from scratch.


ChatGPT said:
You're very welcome, Nick ‚Äî and I'd be glad to walk you through setting up LocalAI from scratch on your Raspberry Pi 5 with TinyLLaMA and Piper. We‚Äôll install it natively (no Docker) to ensure full performance and offline capability.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Install and Run LocalAI (Native Setup on Raspberry Pi 5)
üì¶ 1. Install Dependencies
Open your terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential cmake protobuf-compiler \
    libopenblas-dev libomp-dev libssl-dev curl \
    git unzip wget pkg-config
üß† 2. Download and Build LocalAI
bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI.git
cd LocalAI
üõ†Ô∏è Build LocalAI (Optimized for ARM64 with GGUF support):
bash
Copy
Edit
make build
This will produce the local-ai binary in the LocalAI directory.

üí° Note: This can take ~10‚Äì30 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 5 (but only needs to be done once).

üóÇÔ∏è 3. Create models/ Folder and Place GGUF Model
Create a models directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir -p ~/LocalAI/models/tinyllama
Download your model (e.g. TinyLLaMA):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/LocalAI/models/tinyllama
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF/resolve/main/tinyllama-1.1B-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
Rename for simplicity:

bash
Copy
Edit
mv tinyllama-1.1B-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf model.gguf
üßæ 4. Create the Model Configuration (model.yaml)
In the same tinyllama folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano model.yaml
Paste this:

yaml
Copy
Edit
name: tinyllama
backend: llama-cpp
parameters:
  model: model.gguf
  temperature: 0.7
  top_p: 0.9
  n_predict: 256
  threads: 4
  stopwords:
    - "</s>"
Save with Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. Run LocalAI
Back in the LocalAI/ directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
./local-ai --models-path ./models --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
You should see:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[INFO] Loading model: tinyllama
[INFO] Server started on http://0.0.0.0:8080
üîç 6. Test in Terminal
In a new terminal, test the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
Expected response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "tinyllama",
      "object": "model"
    }
  ]
}
Now you're ready to use it with your Python script!

üß™ Optional: Run as Background Service
If you want to auto-start LocalAI:

bash
Copy
Edit
nohup ./local-ai --models-path ./models > localai.log 2>&1 &
Or create a systemd service if you want it on boot (I can help with that too).

‚úÖ Next Step:
Now run your chatty_ai.py again!
