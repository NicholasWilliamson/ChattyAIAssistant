Issue 1: Missing Method

The error 'ChattyAIWebServer' object has no attribute 'process_user_request' means this method doesn't exist in your class. You need to either:

Option A: Change to use an existing method name. Look for a method in your class that handles user requests - it might be called something like:

handle_user_request
process_request
handle_conversation
respond_to_user

Option B: Find your existing user request handling code and use that method name instead.

In your handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep method, change this line:

self.process_user_request(user_transcript)

to use your actual method name.

Issue 2: Speed Issue

The wake word is still slow because the transcription is happening before the beep. Let's optimize the flow:

Replace your wake word detection section with this faster version:


# Transcribe and check for wake word

if self.record_wake_word_check():  # This already saved the audio
    # Play beep IMMEDIATELY while transcription happens in background
    self.play_beep()
    self.emit_log("WAKE WORD DETECTED! Starting conversation...", 'success')
    
    # Now transcribe (this happens after beep, so user gets faster feedback)
    transcript = self.transcribe_audio(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO)
    
    if transcript and self.detect_wake_word(transcript):
        self.emit_conversation(f"Wake word detected: {transcript}", 'wake_word')
        # Handle the wake word detection
        self.handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep()
    else:
        # False positive - re-enable wake word detection
        self.wake_word_active = True

Quick Fix Steps:

Find your existing method name:

grep -n "def.*request\|def.*conversation\|def.*respond" chatty_ai.py

Replace process_user_request with the correct method name in your handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep method.

Apply the faster wake word flow above to move the beep before transcription.

The key insight is: play the beep as soon as audio is recorded, then do the transcription. This gives immediate audio feedback while the slower transcription happens in the background.

What method names do you see when you run that grep command?
