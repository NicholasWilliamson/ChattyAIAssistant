I am manually stepping though the setup_wyoming_voice_ai.sh file.

I ran: (venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Downloads/Academy-main/Lesson6 $ deactivate || true

INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of wyoming-faster-whisper to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install wyoming-faster-whisper==2.0.0, wyoming-satellite==1.0.0 and wyoming==1.4.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested wyoming==1.4.1
    wyoming-satellite 1.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.4.1
    wyoming-faster-whisper 2.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.5.2

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

Again you have not fixed this. This is very frustrating. I think you do not want to fix this as you want me to use ChatGPT as my AI Assistant. I plan to offer the user an option to select a locally hosted LLM or ChatGPT via WiFi in the future if this issue can be fixed.

However, if you cannot fix this issue now, I will ask Claude for help to fix this and offer the user an option to use Claude via WiFi as their AI Assistant.

How can I fix this right now if you want me to offer the user an option to select ChatGPT via WiFi for their preferred AI Assistant model?
?
