
Thank you, Claude,

I restarted my chatty-ai.service and chatty-ai-preloader.service services and checked that they were running correctly.

I rebooted the Raspberry PI 5 16GB.

It played the Chatty_AI_starting.mp4 correctly with audio once.

However, it did not open up the chatty_loading.html or Chatty_AI_HighTech.html web pages in kiosk mode.

After about 2 minutes, I opened up my Chromium browser with http://localhost:5000 and got the following error meesage:

This site can’t be reached
localhost refused to connect.
Try:

Checking the connection
Checking the proxy and the firewall
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED

I then opened a new browser tab and typed in https://github.com/ and it displayed perfectly.

How can I fix this error?
