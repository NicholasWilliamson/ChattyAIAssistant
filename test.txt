

Thank you, Claude,

I do not want one function to record 4s of audio to try to detect the wake word, then another function to record the user input if the wake word is detected.

I want the script to function as it did previously.

Prior to making the previous changes you recommended, I made a backup of my chatty_ai.py Python script file as chatty_ai_backup.py

I renamed the chatty_ai.py Python script that I made the previous changes to as chatty_ai_error_wake_word.py

I then saved chatty_ai_backup.py as chatty_ai.py

I changed the following lines of code in the chatty_ai.py Python script:

SILENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.035
MIN_SILENCE_DURATION = 1.5

                        if self.current_frame is not None and self.system_running:
                            # Log every 100th frame for debugging
                            if frame_count % 100 == 0:
                                # self.emit_log(f"Streaming frame {frame_count}", 'debug')
                    
                                is_success, buffer = cv2.imencode(".jpg", self.current_frame)
                            if is_success:
                                frame_bytes = buffer.tobytes()
                                yield (b'--frame\r\n'
                                        b'Content-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n' + 
                                        frame_bytes + b'\r\n')
                            frame_count += 1

I then rebooted my Raspberry PI 5.

Everything booted up as required.

The http://localhost:5000 web ui opened up in my Chromium browser in kiosk mode on my Raspberry PI 5.

I clicked on the Initialize button.

The facial recognition function identified me correctly and the AI Assistant spoke the greeting message correctly.
