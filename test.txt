
Thanky you, Claude,

I made a mistake.

Previously, when http://localhost:5000 opened in my Chromium browser on my Raspberry PI 5 and clicked on the Initialize button, the top-right hand side button was green and displayed the text "CONNECTED". The button below this remained red and displayed the text "SYSTEM OFFLINE". 

I checked to ensure WebSocket support is enabled.
