

Thank you, Claude,

I checked my chatty_ai.py Python script and found I had made the typo. I already had this code in my file:

sf.write(USER_AUDIO_FILE, audio_array, save_sample_rate)

I had the following audio constants in my chatty_ai.py Python script:

# Audio files
WAV_FILENAME = "user_input.wav"
RESPONSE_AUDIO = "output.wav"
WAKE_WORD_AUDIO = "wake_word_check.wav"

I then changed these to:

# Audio files
WAV_FILENAME = "user_input.wav"
RESPONSE_AUDIO = "output.wav"
USER_AUDIO_FILE = "user_audio.wav"
WAKE_WORD_AUDIO = "wake_word_audio.wav"

I then replaced this section in my listen_for_wake_word method in my chatty_ai.py Python script:

# Transcribe and check for wake word
transcript = self.transcribe_audio(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO)

if transcript and self.detect_wake_word(transcript):
    self.emit_log("WAKE WORD DETECTED! Starting conversation...", 'success')
    self.emit_conversation(f"Wake word detected: {transcript}", 'wake_word')
    
    # Handle the wake word detection
    self.handle_wake_word_detected()

With this faster version:

# Transcribe and check for wake word
self.emit_log("Transcribing wake word audio...", 'debug')
transcript = self.transcribe_audio(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO)

if transcript and self.detect_wake_word(transcript):
    self.emit_log("WAKE WORD DETECTED! Starting conversation...", 'success')
    # Play beep immediately for faster response
    self.play_beep()
    self.emit_conversation(f"Wake word detected: {transcript}", 'wake_word')
    
    # Handle the wake word detection (but skip the beep since we already played it)
    self.handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep()

I then added this new method to my chatty_ai.py Python script:

def handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep(self):
    """Handle wake word detection without playing beep (beep already played)"""
    try:
        # Disable wake word detection temporarily
        self.wake_word_active = False
        
        # Speak the ready message
        ready_responses = [
            "Hi Nick, I am ready and waiting for your question!",
            "Hello Nick, what can I help you with?",
            "Hi there Nick, I'm listening!",
            "Yes Nick, what would you like to know?",
            "Hi Nick, I am here and ready to help you out!"
        ]
        response = random.choice(ready_responses)
        self.speak_text(response)
        
        # Record user input
        self.emit_log("Please speak your request...", 'info')
        self.emit_conversation("üé§ Listening for user input...", 'info')
        
        if self.record_with_silence_detection():
            # Transcribe user input
            user_transcript = self.transcribe_audio(USER_AUDIO_FILE)
            
            if user_transcript and user_transcript.strip():
                self.emit_conversation(f"üë§ User said: {user_transcript}", 'user_input')
                self.process_user_request(user_transcript)
            else:
                self.speak_text("I didn't catch that. Could you repeat your request?")
                self.emit_conversation("‚ùì No clear speech detected", 'info')
        else:
            self.emit_log("Failed to record user request", 'error')
            self.speak_text("I'm having trouble hearing you. Please try again.")
            self.emit_conversation("üö´ Failed to record audio", 'info')
            
    except Exception as e:
        self.emit_log(f"Error handling wake word: {e}", 'error')
    finally:
        # Re-enable wake word detection after a short delay
        def re_enable_wake_word():
            time.sleep(2)
            self.wake_word_active = True
            self.emit_log("Wake word detection re-enabled", 'debug')
        
        threading.Thread(target=re_enable_wake_word, daemon=True).start()

I rebooted my Raspberry PI 5.

It booted up as required.

I clicked on the Initialize button.

Facial recognition detected me and the AI Assistant spoke the greeting response.
