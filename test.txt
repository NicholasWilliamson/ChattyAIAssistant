The issue is clear now! The server is not actually running properly. Even though you see startup messages, the server is failing to bind to port 5001.
The curl commands are failing to connect, which means the server process is crashing or not listening properly. Let's diagnose this:
First, check if the server is actually running:
bash# Check if the process is still running
ps aux | grep python | grep chatty

# Check what's using port 5001
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :5001
The issue is likely with the eventlet async mode. Let's fix the SocketIO configuration:
bash# Change from eventlet to threading mode (more reliable)
sed -i "s/async_mode='eventlet'/async_mode='threading'/g" chatty_ai.py
Also, let's check if eventlet is installed:
bashpip list | grep eventlet
If eventlet is not installed, that's the problem. Let's install it or switch to threading mode:
bash# Install eventlet
pip install eventlet

# OR alternatively, let's switch to threading mode which is more reliable
Let's also add better error handling to see what's failing. Check the server startup:
bash# Look for any import errors or startup issues
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('.')
try:
    from chatty_ai import ChattyAI
    print('Import successful')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Import error: {e}')
"
Most likely the issue is one of these:

Missing eventlet dependency
Port binding issue
Import error preventing the server from starting properly

Let's also try running with threading mode and debug enabled:
bash# Edit the SocketIO config to use threading and enable debug
sed -i 's/async_mode=.eventlet./async_mode="threading"/g' chatty_ai.py
sed -i 's/logger=False/logger=True/g' chatty_ai.py
sed -i 's/engineio_logger=False/engineio_logger=True/g' chatty_ai.py
Then try running again:
bashpython3 chatty_ai.py
This should give us much better error output to see exactly what's failing. The server startup messages you're seeing might be printed before the actual server binding fails.
Run these commands and let me know:

What the process/port checks show
If eventlet is installed
What the debug output shows when you run with logging enabled
