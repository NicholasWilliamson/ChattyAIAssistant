2. The Problem
Looking at your code, you likely have a duplicate if __name__ == '__main__': block. Your chatty_ai.py probably already has a main() function at the bottom. You need to replace the EXISTING main block, not add a new one.
3. Fix Your chatty_ai.py
Look for the existing main block at the end of your file (it's probably something like):
pythondef main():
    """Main function"""
    try:
        # ... some code ...
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n\nShutdown requested by user")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Replace the ENTIRE existing main section with:
pythonif __name__ == '__main__':
    # Suppress development server warnings
    suppress_flask_warnings()
    try:
        server = ChattyAIWebServer()
        server.socketio.run(server.app, host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=False, use_reloader=False)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n\nShutdown requested by user")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Fatal error: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
4. Test Directly First
Stop the service and test directly to see the actual error:
bashsudo systemctl stop chatty-ai.service
cd /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI
source chatty-venv/bin/activate
python3 chatty_ai.py
This will show you the exact error that's preventing it from starting.
5. Common Issues
If you see an error about:

"Address already in use": Another process is using port 5000. Run sudo lsof -i :5000 to find it
Import errors: A module isn't installed in your venv
Syntax errors: The __name__ should have double underscores on each side: __name__

After fixing, restart the service:
bashsudo systemctl restart chatty-ai.service
sudo systemctl status chatty-ai.service
The service is starting but the Flask app isn't binding to port 5000. Running it directly will show you the exact error.
