Thank you ChatGPT. You are great.

I ran cd ~
git clone https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI.git
cd LocalAI

🛠️ Build LocalAI (Optimized for ARM64 with GGUF support):

make build

This will produce the local-ai binary in the LocalAI directory.

💡 Note: This can take ~10–30 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 5 (but only needs to be done once).

At the end of the build, I received the following messages in my terminal:

Is this an error I should be concerned about or is it okay to continue?
