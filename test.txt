Find the listen_for_wake_word method and look for this section:

# Transcribe and check for wake word

transcript = self.transcribe_audio(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO)

if transcript and self.detect_wake_word(transcript):
    self.emit_log("WAKE WORD DETECTED! Starting conversation...", 'success')
    self.emit_conversation(f"Wake word detected: {transcript}", 'wake_word')
    
    # Handle the wake word detection
    self.handle_wake_word_detected()

Replace it with this faster version:

# Transcribe and check for wake word
self.emit_log("Transcribing wake word audio...", 'debug')
transcript = self.transcribe_audio(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO)

if transcript and self.detect_wake_word(transcript):
    self.emit_log("WAKE WORD DETECTED! Starting conversation...", 'success')
    # Play beep immediately for faster response
    self.play_beep()
    self.emit_conversation(f"Wake word detected: {transcript}", 'wake_word')
    
    # Handle the wake word detection (but skip the beep since we already played it)
    self.handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep()

Fix 4 - Create the no-beep handler:

Add this new method to handle wake word without duplicate beep:

def handle_wake_word_detected_no_beep(self):
    """Handle wake word detection without playing beep (beep already played)"""
    try:
        # Disable wake word detection temporarily
        self.wake_word_active = False
        
        # Speak the ready message
        ready_responses = [
            "Hi Nick, I am ready and waiting for your question!",
            "Hello Nick, what can I help you with?",
            "Hi there Nick, I'm listening!",
            "Yes Nick, what would you like to know?",
            "Hi Nick, I am here and ready to help you out!"
        ]
        response = random.choice(ready_responses)
        self.speak_text(response)
        
        # Record user input
        self.emit_log("Please speak your request...", 'info')
        self.emit_conversation("üé§ Listening for user input...", 'info')
        
        if self.record_with_silence_detection():
            # Transcribe user input
            user_transcript = self.transcribe_audio(USER_AUDIO_FILE)
            
            if user_transcript and user_transcript.strip():
                self.emit_conversation(f"üë§ User said: {user_transcript}", 'user_input')
                self.process_user_request(user_transcript)
            else:
                self.speak_text("I didn't catch that. Could you repeat your request?")
                self.emit_conversation("‚ùì No clear speech detected", 'info')
        else:
            self.emit_log("Failed to record user request", 'error')
            self.speak_text("I'm having trouble hearing you. Please try again.")
            self.emit_conversation("üö´ Failed to record audio", 'info')
            
    except Exception as e:
        self.emit_log(f"Error handling wake word: {e}", 'error')
    finally:
        # Re-enable wake word detection after a short delay
        def re_enable_wake_word():
            time.sleep(2)
            self.wake_word_active = True
            self.emit_log("Wake word detection re-enabled", 'debug')
        
        threading.Thread(target=re_enable_wake_word, daemon=True).start()


Apply these fixes and the issues should be resolved:

The recording error will be fixed
The beep will play immediately when wake word is detected
The overall response time will be faster

The most critical fix is correcting USER_AUDIO_File to USER_AUDIO_FILE - that typo is causing the recording to fail.
