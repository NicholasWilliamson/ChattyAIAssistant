Thank you, Claude,

I rebooted my Raspberry PI 5 as you recommended.

The startup video played with audio and after 70 seconds, http://localhost:5000 automatically opened up in my Chromium browser on my Raspberry PI 5.

I clicked on the Initialize button.

Facial recognition identified me correctly.

However, I did not hear the greeting message this time. Wake word detection started correctly after facial recognition correctly identified me.

The TTS was not working correctly.

I ran: nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~ $ cd Chatty_AI
nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ source chatty-venv/bin/activate
(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ sudo journalctl -u chatty-ai.service -f
