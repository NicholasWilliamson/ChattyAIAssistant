I am manually stepping though the setup_wyoming_voice_ai.sh file.

I ran: pip install \
  wyoming==1.5.2 \
  wyoming-faster-whisper==2.0.0 \
  wyoming-piper==1.5.3

INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of wyoming-piper to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install wyoming-faster-whisper==2.0.0, wyoming-piper==1.5.3 and wyoming==1.5.2 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested wyoming==1.5.2
    wyoming-faster-whisper 2.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.5.2
    wyoming-piper 1.5.3 depends on wyoming>=1.5.3

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

I cannot believe your suggestions still generate errors.

I do not think you know how to solve this error.

I will fix it myself. This is all too frustrating and I do not have another two days to waste with trial and error from your recommendations trying to get this fixed.
