

Thank you, Claude,

I made the changes you recommended.

I rebooted my Raspberry PI 5. Everything booted up as normal.

The web ui page loaded.

I clicked on the START SYSTEM button.

Facial recognition detected my correctly and the wake word detection thread started.

Wake word detection accurately detected my wake worh phrase.

I could then interact with the AI Assistant.

When the AI Assistant did not detect any wake word phrase for 30 seconds, it the spoke the bored response and told me a joke from the jokes.text file.

The same thing happened when the AI Assistant did not detect any wake word phrase for another 30 seconds, it spoke the response and then told me a fun fact from the fun_facts.txt file.

However, I would like to include a 0.5 second pause between when the AI Assistant speaks the bored response or waiting response and when it speaks "let me tell you a joke", or "let me tell you a fun fact".

I would also like to include a 0.5 second pause between when the AI Assistant says "let me tell you a joke" or "let me tell you a fun fact" and when it speaks the joke or the fun fact. This will sound more like natural speech.

Furthermore, in my previous terminal version of chatty_ai.py, if the AI Assistant could not identify a person using facial recognition, it would speak the bored response, listening response or waiting response from the bored_responses_generic.txt, listening_responses_generic.txt or waiting_responses_generic.txt files respectfully. I had the following response files listed in my previous version of chatty_ai.py:

# Response files
JOKES_FILE = "jokes.txt"
FUN_FACTS_FILE = "fun_facts.txt"
BORED_RESPONSES_GENERIC_FILE = "bored_responses_generic.txt"
WAITING_RESPONSES_GENERIC_FILE = "waiting_responses_generic.txt"
LISTENING_RESPONSES_GENERIC_FILE = "listening_responses_generic.txt"
WAITING_RESPONSES_FILE = "waiting_responses.txt"
WARNING_RESPONSES_FILE = "warning_responses.txt"
GREETING_RESPONSES_FILE = "greeting_responses.txt"
BORED_RESPONSES_FILE = "bored_responses.txt"
VISITOR_GREETING_RESPONSES_FILE = "visitor_greeting_responses.txt"

Please amend my chatty_ai.py Python script to include the generic responses for visitors.

Furthermore, if a person has not been detected for 5 minutes after initially detecting a person, please also clear the peron's image from being displayed as well.

Please amend my chatty_ai.py Python script to include the requested changes.
