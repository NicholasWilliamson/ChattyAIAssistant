(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ 

The application starts up but there are a number of warnings, including WARNING - No face encodings file found. Face recognition disabled.

The PI Camera Module 2 camera's detection window is not opening correctly, however, there were a number of photographs snapped by the camera but this were saved to my /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI folder..

It did not detect me when my face was fully in the field of view of the camera but most of the photographs snapped clearly showed my face

How can I fix this?
