
Great update, Nick. The fact that Chromium didn't freeze this time is progress! Since the video shows but doesn’t play, this is likely due to autoplay restrictions or missing muted attribute, which Chromium requires to allow autoplay without user interaction.

Let’s fix this step by step:

✅ Step 1: Update Your HTML <video> Tag
Chromium requires the muted and autoplay attributes (sometimes also playsinline) for videos to autoplay without user input. Please edit your index.html file:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI_UI/index.html
Update your video tag to look like this:

html
Copy
Edit
<video id="intro" autoplay muted playsinline>
  <source src="Chatty_AI_starting.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
Save and close (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

✅ Step 2: Add JavaScript Fallback to Force Play (if needed)
Sometimes the browser still needs an extra push after DOM is loaded. Add this at the bottom of your <body> in the same index.html:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    const video = document.getElementById('intro');
    if (video) {
      video.muted = true;
      video.play().catch((e) => {
        console.error("Autoplay failed:", e);
      });
    }
  });
</script>
✅ Step 3: Reboot and Test Again
Reboot your Pi:

bash
Copy
Edit
reboot
Your Chromium kiosk should now load, and the video should autoplay without needing input.

✅ Step 4: (Optional) Add Controls or Autorestart Logic
If you want the video to loop or disappear after playing (e.g. showing the assistant UI), you can add one of these to the <video> tag:

To loop forever:

html
Copy
Edit
<video autoplay muted playsinline loop>
To trigger an event when finished:

html
Copy
Edit
<script>
  document.getElementById('intro').addEventListener('ended', function () {
    // Replace video with UI, or redirect
    window.location.href = 'assistant.html'; // or toggle display
  });
</script>
Let me know how the playback goes after these changes — we’ll take it from there.
