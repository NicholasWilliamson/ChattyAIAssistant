Thank you ChatGPT. I was manually stepping though the setup_wyoming_voice_ai.sh file.

I ran: (venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Downloads/Academy-main/Lesson6 $ pip3 install wyoming-satellite wyoming-faster-whisper wyoming-piper

ERROR: Cannot install wyoming-faster-whisper==0.0.1, wyoming-faster-whisper==0.0.2, wyoming-faster-whisper==0.0.3, wyoming-faster-whisper==1.0.0, wyoming-faster-whisper==1.0.1, wyoming-faster-whisper==2.0.0 and wyoming-satellite==1.0.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    wyoming-satellite 1.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.4.1
    wyoming-faster-whisper 2.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.5.2
    wyoming-faster-whisper 1.0.1 depends on wyoming==1.1.0
    wyoming-faster-whisper 1.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.1.0
    wyoming-faster-whisper 0.0.3 depends on wyoming==0.0.1
    wyoming-faster-whisper 0.0.2 depends on wyoming==0.0.1
    wyoming-faster-whisper 0.0.1 depends on wyoming==0.0.1

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

How can I fix these errors or can I just ignore them and continue manually proceeding through the setup_wyoming_voice_ai.sh file?
