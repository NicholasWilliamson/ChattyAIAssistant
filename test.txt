Great! The facial recognition is now working correctly. Let's fix the remaining issues:

Wake word detection not working
Poor quality jokes and repetitive fun facts
Missing delays and personalization

bash# First, let's find the wake word detection code
grep -n -A 10 -B 5 "detect_wake_word\|record_wake_word" chatty_ai.py
bash# Find the bored response and joke generation code
grep -n -A 15 -B 5 "bored.*response\|tell.*joke\|fun.*fact" chatty_ai.py
bash# Check the audio recording parameters and thresholds
grep -n -A 5 -B 5 "silence_threshold\|SILENCE_THRESHOLD\|record.*audio" chatty_ai.py
Let me create a fix for all these issues:Wake Word Detection & LLM Response FixesCode # FIXES FOR CHATTY_AI.PY

# 1. FIX WAKE WORD DETECTION - Add debugging and adjust sensitivity
# Find the record_wake_word_check method and add debug logging:

def record_wake_word_check(self):
    """Record audio for wake word detection with debugginNow let's apply these fixes. First, let's backup your current file and then apply the changes:
bash# Create backup
cp chatty_ai.py chatty_ai.py.backup_before_fixes

# Apply the key fixes one by one:

# 1. Lower the silence threshold for more sensitive wake word detection
sed -i 's/SILENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.035/SILENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.015/' chatty_ai.py

# 2. Let's find the exact methods we need to replace and update them
grep -n -A 5 "def record_wake_word_check" chatty_ai.py
grep -n -A 5 "def detect_wake_word" chatty_ai.py
grep -n -A 5 "def check_for_bored_response" chatty_ai.py
Since we need to make several precise changes, let me help you update the code step by step. First run those grep commands to see the current methods, then I'll give you the exact sed commands or manual edits needed.
The main issues we're fixing:

Wake word detection too insensitive - Lower threshold, add debugging
Poor LLM prompts - Better prompts for jokes and facts with randomization
Missing personalization - Add person's name to responses
No delays - Add 1-second delays as requested
Repetitive content - Use randomization and better LLM parameters

Run those grep commands first so I can see exactly what we're working with, then I'll provide the precise replacement code.
