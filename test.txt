Fix 1: Face Encodings Numpy Error

The encodings file was created with a different numpy version. Let's regenerate or fix it:

# Create a fix script

cat > /home/nickspi5/Chatty_AI/fix_encodings.py << 'EOF'
import pickle
import numpy as np

try:
    # Try to load existing encodings
    with open("encodings.pickle", "rb") as f:
        data = pickle.load(f)
    print(f"Loaded {len(data['encodings'])} encodings successfully")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    print("You may need to regenerate your face encodings with the current numpy version")
EOF

python3 fix_encodings.py

If that fails, you'll need to regenerate your face encodings with the current numpy version.

Fix 2: Bored Response Not Triggering

The bored response timer might not be starting. Check your greet_person method to ensure it sets:

def greet_person(self, name):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    self.last_greeting_time[name] = current_time
    self.last_interaction_time = current_time
    
    # Enable wake word detection after greeting
    self.wake_word_active = True
    self.last_bored_response_time = current_time  # THIS LINE IS CRITICAL
    self.bored_cycle = 0
    
    self.emit_log(f"âœ… Greeted {name} - Wake word detection now active", 'success')

Fix 3: Wake Word Audio Issue

If wake word detection still has issues, add this simpler version temporarily:

def record_wake_word_check(self):
    """Record short audio clip for wake word detection"""
    try:
        if not self.audio_recording_lock.acquire(blocking=False):
            return False
        
        try:
            # Use default settings
            audio_data = sd.rec(int(5 * 16000), samplerate=16000, channels=1, dtype='float32')
            sd.wait()
            
            rms = np.sqrt(np.mean(audio_data**2))
            
            if rms > SILENCE_THRESHOLD * 1.2:
                sf.write(WAKE_WORD_AUDIO, audio_data, 16000)
                return True
            return False
                
        finally:
            self.audio_recording_lock.release()
            
    except Exception as e:
        self.emit_log(f"Wake word recording error: {e}", 'error')
        return False

The system is 99% working! Just these minor fixes needed for full functionality.
