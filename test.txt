Thank you ChatGPT. I am manually stepping though the setup_wyoming_voice_ai.sh file.

ERROR: Cannot install wyoming-faster-whisper==1.0.1, wyoming-satellite==1.0.0 and wyoming==1.4.1 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested wyoming==1.4.1
    wyoming-satellite 1.0.0 depends on wyoming==1.4.1
    wyoming-faster-whisper 1.0.1 depends on wyoming==1.1.0

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
