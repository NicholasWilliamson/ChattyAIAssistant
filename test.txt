Well, I finally got to start Month 4 and just started Lesson 1.

I trusted the instructions manually typed in this for my dockercompse.yml file.

services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: homeassistant
    image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    devices:
      - ./dev/ttyAMCO:/dev/ttyAMCO
    restart: unless-stopped
    network_mode: host
    privileged: true

Following the video and finding the instructor saying this:

I am not quite sure what this line should be: - ./dev/ttyAMCO:/dev/ttyAMCO

Well, I tried it and immediate fail.

Creating homeassistant ... error

ERROR: for homeassistant  Cannot start service homeassistant: error gathering device information while adding custom device "./dev/ttyAMCO": no such file or directory
ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.

Is this really how to run a training course?

Has anyone else encountered this error?

I am only really interested in a couple of aspects of Home Assistant, due to being in Australia and having to buy a load of compatible kit if I want to setup a full local Smart Home.

I can see a few cool aspects I can add to my Chatty AI Assistant.

Also setting up mood lighting is cool and smart switches to turn off everything when leaving or turning on all lights if I hear a weird noise at night that needs investigating is worth my effort.

I put a massive effort into Month 3 as that was my main interest to sign on for this course but TBH, this error straight away after waiting for Docker to start up is a major turn off.

I would redo the Month 1 training video for starters!

If no one has encountered this error, (which I highly doubt), and has a solution to fix it, I will do it myself but I feel this is really unprofessional and very dissappointing!
