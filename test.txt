
Thank you, Claude,

I am testing Chatty AI right now.

I am happy with the processing time for the facial recognition detection.

I am happy with the processing time for wake word detection.

I am happy with the processing time for the command responses.

However, the processing time for LLM responses to users questions is very slow at 15 seconds plus before the LLM starts to speak it's response. This is much slower than with my old 8GB Raspberry Pi 5 and MicroSD card configuration which only took 6 to 8 seconds before speaking it's response to the users questions. I would expect my new 16GB Raspberry Pi5 plus SSD to respond more quickly to users questions that my old setup did.

How can I check the logs to show you the LLM response times that must be optimized for quicker response times?

Also, how can I add functionality to my setup to ensure that the Raspberry Pi 5's speaker volume and microphone is set to 100% prior to the startup video playing.

Additionally, I now have 2 cameras attached to my Raspberry Pi 5 board. One camera is a Pi Camera Module 3 camera and the other camera is a Waveshare IMX219 160 IR-Cut Night Vision Camera.

I think the facial recognition method in my chatty_ai.py python script is using the Waveshare Camera instead of using the Pi Camera Module 2 camera.

How can we check which cameras are available for use and which camera my chatty_ai.py python script is using?
