Another issue exists now, however.

When the wake word is detected, and I ask a question or speak a command, the AI Assistant does not stop recording my talking after 1.5 seconds of talking, indicating that I have said everything I wanted to say for that question or command.

It continues recording for the full 30.2 second duration.

I am wondering if increasing the setting from 0.15 back to 0.35 will correct this?

If not, how can I fix this?

Also, I want the maximum number of tokens used for the LLM's response to be 50. This setting should also be able to be changed.

Please fix this if need be.
