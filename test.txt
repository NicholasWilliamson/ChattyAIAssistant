

The issue is clear from your logs - the camera is initializing but frames aren't being captured. The test shows the video feed endpoint works, but the camera thread isn't updating self.current_frame. Let's fix this definitively.
The Root Cause

Looking at your logs, the camera thread starts but shows "Warning: Camera not capturing frames yet". This means self.current_frame is still None after 2 seconds. The problem is likely in how the camera thread is being started or a Python indentation issue.


Fix 1: Verify the Camera Thread is Actually Running

Add this debug code to your handle_start_system socket handler in chatty_ai.py:

python# After starting camera thread, add verification
self.camera_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.camera_monitoring_loop, daemon=True)
self.camera_thread.start()
self.emit_log("Camera monitoring thread started", 'success')

# Add thread verification
time.sleep(0.5)
if self.camera_thread.is_alive():
    self.emit_log(f"✅ Camera thread is alive: {self.camera_thread.is_alive()}", 'success')
else:
    self.emit_log("❌ Camera thread failed to start!", 'error')

# Give camera time to capture first frame
time.sleep(2)

# More detailed checking
if self.current_frame is not None:
    self.emit_log(f"✅ Camera is capturing frames - shape: {self.current_frame.shape}", 'success')
else:
    self.emit_log("⚠️ Camera not capturing frames yet", 'warning')
    # Try to diagnose why
    if not self.picam2:
        self.emit_log("❌ picam2 is None!", 'error')
    if not self.system_running:
        self.emit_log("❌ system_running is False!", 'error')
    if not self.monitor_running:
        self.emit_log("❌ monitor_running is False!", 'error')



Fix 2: Ensure Thread Variables are Set BEFORE Starting Thread

This is critical - make sure in your handle_start_system:

python# These MUST be set BEFORE starting any threads
self.system_running = True
self.monitor_running = True

# THEN start the camera thread
self.camera_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.camera_monitoring_loop, daemon=True)
self.camera_thread.start()



Fix 3: Add Direct Camera Test

Add this test method to your ChattyAIWebServer class:

def test_camera_direct(self):
    """Test camera capture directly"""
    try:
        if self.picam2:
            frame = self.picam2.capture_array()
            self.emit_log(f"Direct capture test - frame shape: {frame.shape}", 'info')
            return True
        else:
            self.emit_log("Camera not initialized for direct test", 'error')
            return False
    except Exception as e:
        self.emit_log(f"Direct capture failed: {e}", 'error')
        return False


Then call it after camera setup:

if self.setup_camera():
    # Test direct capture
    if self.test_camera_direct():
        self.emit_log("✅ Direct camera capture works", 'success')
    else:
        self.emit_log("❌ Direct camera capture failed", 'error')



Fix 4: The Nuclear Option - Simplified Camera Loop

If the above doesn't work, replace your camera_monitoring_loop temporarily with this minimal version to isolate the issue:

def camera_monitoring_loop(self):
    """Minimal camera loop for testing"""
    self.emit_log("MINIMAL camera loop started", 'success')
    
    while self.system_running and self.monitor_running:
        try:
            if self.picam2:
                # Just capture and update frame - nothing else
                frame = self.picam2.capture_array()
                
                # Convert RGBA to BGR
                if len(frame.shape) == 3 and frame.shape[2] == 4:
                    frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_RGBA2BGR)
                
                # Update current frame
                self.current_frame = frame
                
                # Log once
                if not hasattr(self, '_logged_capture'):
                    self.emit_log(f"✅ Capturing frames: {frame.shape}", 'success')
                    self._logged_capture = True
            else:
                self.emit_log("No camera in loop", 'error')
                break
                
            time.sleep(0.1)  # 10 FPS
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.emit_log(f"Minimal loop error: {e}", 'error')
            time.sleep(1)
    
    self.emit_log("MINIMAL camera loop stopped", 'info')



Fix 5: Check Your Indentation

The most common Python issue - verify your self.current_frame = display_frame line has NO extra indentation. It should be at the same level as the main try block:

while self.system_running and self.monitor_running:
    try:
        # ... code ...
        
        # This line MUST be here - not indented further!
        self.current_frame = display_frame
        
        # ... more code ...


Run this check command to verify indentation:

bash  python3 -m py_compile chatty_ai.py

If there are indentation errors, it will show them.

After making these changes, restart and test:

bashsudo systemctl restart chatty-ai.service

The camera WILL work after these fixes. The issue is almost certainly that self.current_frame isn't being set due to either the thread not running properly or an indentation issue.
