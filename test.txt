Thank you ChatGPT.

I followed you advice to try to install a trusted, public version of piper-tts that does not need authorization:

I ran: (chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ pip install git+https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-tts.git
Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple
Collecting git+https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-tts.git

  Running command git clone --filter=blob:none --quiet https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-tts.git /tmp/pip-req-build-n_hx3ffa

(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ pip install rhasspy-piper
Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://www.piwheels.org/simple
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement rhasspy-piper (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for rhasspy-piper
(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ python3 -m pip show rhasspy-piper
WARNING: Package(s) not found: rhasspy-piper
(chatty-venv) nickspi5@raspberrypi1:~/Chatty_AI $ 

I also got a 404 Not found error when i typed https://github.com/rhasspy/piper-tts. There is a https://github.com/rhasspy/piper repository avaiable however.

Can we just get this fixed and running right now please instead of going around in a loop?
