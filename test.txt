Thank you, Claude,

I ran: def detect_wake_word(self, text):
    """Check if text contains wake word"""
    if not text:
        return False
        
    text_cleaned = text.lower().replace(',', '').replace('.', '').strip()
    
    for wake_word in WAKE_WORDS:
        wake_word_cleaned = wake_word.lower().strip()
        if wake_word_cleaned in text_cleaned:
            self.emit_log(f"Wake word detected: '{wake_word}' in '{text}'", 'success')
            return True
    
    # Log that no wake word was found (for debugging)
    self.emit_log(f"No wake word found in: '{text_cleaned}'", 'debug')
    return False

I then made the changes you recommended to chatty_ai.py

I then ran python3 chatty_ai.py

I then opened http://localhost:5001 in my Chromium browser.

I then clicked on the Start Service button.

The AI Assistant then detected me correctly using facial recognition and greeted me.

The wake word function then started correctly and detected my spoken wake words.
